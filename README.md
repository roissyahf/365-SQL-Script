# 365 Learning Data Challenge

Just a repository to play around with DML stuff in MySQL to answer the challenge conducted by the 365 Data Science under ["The 365 Learning Data Challenge"](https://365datascience.com/news/365-learning-data-challenge/). In short, we were asked to create a dashboard using Tableau or Power BI. We were given a MySQL database and a collection of 11 .csv files. My approach is to explore the database so that I better understand it, then visualize my finding using the .csv files in Tableau.

What am I trying to do?
1. Ask business questions 
2. Explore the relationship between 11 tables in the MySQL Database
3. Start writing queries
4. Enhancement
5. Visualize finding in Tableau

Here attached the EER diagram of the database. You can visit my dashboard via [this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/StudentEngagement_16693737522050/dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link), Enjoy!
